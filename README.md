# world 404

World 404 is a world that is no longer safe for civilization. A world that used to thrive with life, towering cities, economies and growth is no more.
    
The world is post-apocalyptic, not safe for humans, the elements in the environment can be deadly if exposed to Humans. Life has some how managed to still survive on the surface of the planet, over hundreds of years after devastating events, radiation levels have lowered in some areas, but the risk for humans to venture out is too high. The human population has been underground for decades and have adjusted to their new environments. To survive, Humanics have been created by the last surviving underground tech industry factories which were not affected by the events that occurred on the surface of the planet. These Humanics can resist harsh environments that the world is today. Their purpose...gathering resources, reconnaissance and planetary mapping.

Humanic-X robots are the latest model of the Humanics range, with extreme mechanical engineering, they have proven to be the best robots for unknown territory exploration, made from a mixture of newly discovered metals in the last decade. This new range of Humanics have the ability for firmware upgrades by direct links to satellite networks that orbit the planet.

These satellite networks are under full capacity, the networks are being compromised and controlled by opposing factions on a regular basis, fighting for ultimate control of all Humanic-X range robots in circulation. The network grid that connects all the satellites together is unstable, with hardware made on the surface of the planet made from materials not designed to withstand the current environment, the network regularly resets, allowing all factions to upgrade firmware on any of their Humanics currently exploring, but also losing full control to any computer networks they hacked.

The Humanic-X instructions are created by programmers, an elite group of humans that have the knowledge to write code. Factions live underground, where it is safe from the harsh environments on the surface. They write the firmware that can be uploaded to the humanics through the unstable satellite networks. The elite few in each faction, use computers to analyse the progress of their humanics. Detailed information that the humanic collects thorugh exploration is stored in the memory core and is beamed back through the Satellite network when the signal is strong.

The world is not the same as you once knew it. Nobody can be trusted. Factions that were once united have turned against each other due to disagreements and different visions of a better future for the huamn race.

It's kill or be killed. Defend your faction, no matter the cost.
